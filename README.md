# Embellishment Counter
Written by Roy G.
--------------------------------------

This Embellishment counter is a script that I have created for the sole purpose of quickly going through an excel spreadsheet and tallying all the players and teams that have committed an "Embellishment" penalty during the 2014 - 2015 NHL Season. In this directory, I have attached the example Excel document that accompanies this script as well as a sample output that comes with this.

### Version 
1.0.0

### Future Enhancements
* In the future I would like to make the scripts faster and not rely on a local copy of the boxscores.
