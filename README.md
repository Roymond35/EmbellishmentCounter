# Embellishment Counter
Written by Roy G.
--------------------------------------

This Embellishment counter is a script that I have created for the sole purpose of quickly going through an excel spreadsheet and tallying all the players and teams that have committed an "Embellishment" penalty during the 2014 - 2015 NHL Season. In this directory, I have attached the example Excel document that accompanies this script as well as a sample output that comes with this.

### Version 
1.0.0

### Future Enhancements
* In the future I would like to implement a system in which the python script will scan through an RSS feed or some other feed in order to automatically get the Embellishment penalties called during the game. The limitation on this is finding an RSS feed that actually shows all the penalties that occur during the game.
* For the 2015-2016 season I would like to expand this counter so that it keeps track of every penalty called during a game. This is purely for my knowledge and I'm not sure what sort of benefit this would provide. I just feel that it would be a good talking point to know if a certain player normally gets called for what specific penalty. The reason I am shooting for a 2015-2016 season timeframe is because I have already gathered a half season worth of data on just embellishment. If the first point gets implemented then the second one could easily be as well.
